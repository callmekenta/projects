The bug where the death scene doesnt properly show up has been patched as well as the collision with the NavMeshAgents



## Overview

For this major group project, you will work on a 3D game of your choosing.  It should be production ready, so take care to collect the right assets, make the game playable, make it fun, and test it thoroughly before submitting!

This project is a major body of work.  You are expected to turn in a completed game experience, though you may not have time to develop more than one level or simple enemies.  You will be expected to combine all of the 3D graphics concepts (as well as user interfaces) into your project, plus you will be expected to add some content that you learned on your own.

_**Note:**  This project is the equivalent of a final examination, and will be marked accordingly._

The nature of the project is entirely up to you, but you should choose a project that gives you the opportunity to demonstrate the concepts learned in this course.  Games like first/third-person shooters (e.g. Call of Duty series), first/third-person RPGs (e.g. The Witcher and Elder Scrolls series), click-to-move RPGs (e.g. Diablo series), turn-based RPGs (e.g. Final Fantasy series), 3D platformers (e.g. Super Mario Odyssey), 3D puzzle games (e.g. Portal) are ideal as they use many of the course concepts.  However, if you have a different type of game in mind, contact the instructor just to be sure you wonâ€™t be missing anything critical.

The only approved game engine (by default) is Unity, and the language should be C#.  If you have any other ideas, contact the instructor for approval before beginning work.
